Welcome to **quantum-ish**â€”my living collection of notes, thoughts, and beginner-friendly breakdowns as I learn about quantum computing and its real-world implications. I'm not a quantum physicist (yet?), just an IT Program Manager with a curiosity for how quantum tech intersects with security, policy, and human impact.
